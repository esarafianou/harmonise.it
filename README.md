> Practice music theory harmony rules

harmonise.it is a platform which which helps music theory and harmony students
practice harmony rules. Based on a theme with a given soprano or bass voice,
users can complete the rest of the voices and create a music piece with four voices
(soprano, alto, tenoro, bass) that comply with the music harmony rules.

The platform provides the users with a variety of music themes both with a
given soprano and bass and with different levels of difficulty. Users can
choose to start solving a music theme, continue editing music themes or
review their completed music pieces.

_This project is under development. harmonise.it is not live yet._
